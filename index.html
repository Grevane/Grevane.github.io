				<br><br><p class="lead">Eclipse is an IDE used for programming java. Its base workspace and extensible plug-in systems allow for customization within the environment. While Eclipse is mainly associated with Java, it may also be used within other programming languages (C, C++, COBOL, JavaScript, Python, and Others).</p>
				
				<p> The Eclipse Foundation is a not-for-profit, member supported stewardship program for Eclipse. This open source community of members and industry vendors acts as the framework to continuing the development of the Eclipse IDE. In 2006, the foundation has coordinated annual “Simultaneous Release” for the Eclipse platform and other Eclipse projects. </p>
				
				<p>Eclipse was initially release in November 2001, with a version of 1.0, with a “Stable Release” being produced on March 14th 2017 version 4.6.3. (A stable release is the sum of the stages of development and maturity for the cycle of software). Future versions have planned releases in June 2017 (Oxygen) and June 2018 (Photon)</p>
				
				<p>Eclipse’s architecture is based around plug-ins as well as functionality based on the runtime system. On top of being extensible, Eclipse can also work with typesetting languages (LaTeX) as well as telnet and DBM systems. The support of Java and CVS  is provided through Eclipse Software Development Kit with support for version control through 3rd party plug-ins. </p>
				
				<p>By using plug-ins, Eclipse can provide support with many different features, an example of which is a plug-in for support UMLs for Sequence and other UML diagrams. This allows for flexibility when planning out software and going through the development process.</p><br><br>
